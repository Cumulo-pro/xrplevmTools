# XRPL EVM Consensus System Metrics Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the consensus metrics used in the **XRPL EVM** project, which integrates the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). These metrics, collected from the **CometBFT** consensus engine, are crucial for monitoring the performance, security, and health of validator nodes within the network.

The document is structured into different metric categories, including block synchronization, validator activity, transaction processing, memory and CPU usage, network performance, and mempool statistics. Each metric is explained with its description, value interpretation, and example values.

By leveraging these metrics, network operators and developers can ensure optimal performance, detect potential issues, and maintain a secure and efficient blockchain environment.

Monitoring the **average block processing time** is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of block finalization. If the average time increases, it may indicate **performance bottlenecks** or issues with the node's processing power. Keeping this metric within an optimal range helps ensure the **smooth functioning of the network** and avoids delays in transaction finalization.

**Calculation:**  
\[
\text{Average Block Processing Time} = \frac{\text{cometbft_state_block_processing_time_sum}}{\text{cometbft_state_block_processing_time_count}}
\]

**Example Values:**
